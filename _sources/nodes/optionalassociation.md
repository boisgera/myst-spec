Internal relation from one node to another; not required by node

- __identifier__: _string_ - identifier that may match another node; value is unparsed and must be normalized such that whitespace is collapsed to single space, initial/final space is trimmed, and case is folded 
- __label__: _string_ - node label; character escapes and references are parsed; may be normalized to a unique identifier
